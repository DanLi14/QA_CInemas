Arrakis is a harsh desert planet and the only source of spice, a valuable substance that bestows its users heightened vitality and expanded consciousness. It is critical for interstellar travel as it allows Spacing Guild Navigators to use a limited form of prescience to safely navigate interstellar space. In reality, Shaddam intends to have House Harkonnen stage a coup to retake the planet with aid of the Emperor's Sardaukar troops, eradicating House Atreides, whose influence threatens Shaddam's control. Leto is apprehensive but sees the political advantages of controlling the spice planet and forming an alliance with its native population, skilled fighters known as the Fremen."
